Introduction
============

The **uap** package is a framework to configure, run, and control
large data multi-step analyses.
Its main focus is on the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data.

The aim of this data processing pipeline is to enable robust and straightforward
bioinformatics data evaluation.
It is implemented in Python, runs under GNU/Linux and can be controlled from the
command-line interface.
Although the primary focus is the evaluation of sequencing data, its design
allows for a variety of other applications.
